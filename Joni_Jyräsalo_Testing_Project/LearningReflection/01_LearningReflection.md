> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- The instructions were very clear and it made the testing experience quite easy and fun.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I looked at the provided notes/examples and wrote my test cases according to them.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
- I don't have any testing experience before this course, so I don't have anything to recommend.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I only used Visual Studio Code.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I didn't find any trouble.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-I didn't find any trouble using Github. I've used it once before in a web development course.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I'm interested in learning more about different frameworks and languages, like Robot Framework.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Automation Tool and Language proficiency (e.g. Selenium, Appium, TestNG, JUnit, Robot Framework etc.), Programming Languages (e.g. Java, Python), Knowledge of different Software Development Life Cycles and Testing Frameworks.



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Anything related to abovementioned skills, in addition I'd want to show evidence of soft skills such as analytical thinking, communication and problem-solving.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- As the course was about testing fundamentals, I think that it did succeed helping me gain fundamental knowledge about testing and its processes. I guess there could be some optional assignments to delve more deeply into, for example, how to utilize the different testing tools and languages. However, there's always the option to learn more independently or take further more advanced courses in the future.
